    <h2>All About Me</h2>
    <p>I am Miles Shinmachi, a college student at both California State University, Long Beach and Cerritos College. I am a second year student who entered my college years through the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. I am a declared Computer Science major who is studying to pursue a career in Front-end Website Development. The career focuses on the UI or user-interface of the website that the user interacts with. The languages that I am currently studying are HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript. In addition to that, I watch LinkedIn Learning videos and am currently working on side projects to help hone in and apply the skills that I have acquired during my studies.</p>

    <h2>Whenever I have free time to spare...</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> I like to play Roblox with my little sister</li>
        <li> Watch different types of anime such as Demon Slayer</li>
        <li> Listen to music (Japanese City Pop, Rock, RnB, Pop, 80s)</li>
    </ol>

    <p>My favorite website is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/">LinkedIn Learning</a> because it helps me gain the upper level knowledge that I need to learn that I cannot find anywhere else.</p>
