            <h2>All About Me:</h2>
            <p>I am Miles Shinmachi, a college student at both California State University, Long Beach and Cerritos College. I am a second year student who entered my college years through the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. I am a declared Computer Science major who is studying to pursue a career in Front-end Website Development. The career focuses on the UI or user-interface of the website that the user interacts with. The languages that I am currently studying are HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript. In addition to that, I watch LinkedIn Learning videos and am currently working on side projects to help hone in and apply the skills that I have acquired during my studies.</p>
